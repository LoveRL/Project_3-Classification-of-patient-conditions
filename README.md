# Project_3-Classification-of-patient-conditions
Providing multi-classification of 8 classes models of patient conditions using LightGBM, KNN, DecisionTree, and DQN for imbalanced classification.

Here are some issues dealt with.

- Drawing out visualization for results of each algorithms.
  - Graphviz for DecisionTree
  - plot for LightGBM(https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/examples/python-guide)
  - plot for KNN
