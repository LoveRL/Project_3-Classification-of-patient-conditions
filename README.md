# Project_3-Classification-of-patient-conditions
Providing classification models of patient conditions using LightGBM, XGboost, KNN, DecisionTree, and DQN for imbalanced classification, etc.

Here are some issues dealt with.

- Drawing out visualization for results of each algorithms.
  - Graphviz for DecisionTree
  - plot for LightGBM(https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/tree/master/examples/python-guide), XGBoost
  - plot for KNN
